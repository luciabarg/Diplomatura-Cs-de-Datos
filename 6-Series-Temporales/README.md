# Time series forecasting

This is the repository for the practices of "Time series analysis", a graduate course at FaMAF's #DiploDatos, National University of CÃ³rdoba

Based in "A short course on forecasting" by Marcel Scharth, The University of Sydney.

This material draws on the [Forecasting Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp2) textbook by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. While the textbook and Rob Hyndman's [DataCamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-using-r) use R, our tutorials provide a Python version of related content, but based only in [**statsmodels**](https://www.statsmodels.org) and the [scipy stack](https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html).

This version: September 6, 2019.
